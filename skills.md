# Skills & Experience

I currently work as a Data Scientist (Bioinformatics) at the [Joint Genome Institute](https://jgi.doe.gov/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/) where I develop analysis pipelines and tools for epigenomic experiments (chIP-seq, methyl-seq, RNA-seq).
