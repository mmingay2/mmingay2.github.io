# Web Applications

#### Below are some examples of web applications I built, mainly using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

---

##### Explore gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patient data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)

[See a Live Demo](https://mmingay2.shinyapps.io/tcga_aml/)

##### This app allows you to type in terms of interest (ex. AML) and get gene sets from [MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). The genes in the gene set you select will then be coloured red on the RNA-seq scatterplot.

#### Below are some useful visualization libraries that I regularly utilize to study genomics data

##### This is an example of a custom IGV browser that can be configurated to display BAM, Wig, BigWig, VCF and a multitude of genomic regions files for validation and exploration.
