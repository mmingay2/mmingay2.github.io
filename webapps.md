# Web Applications

## [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) Apps

Explore gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patient data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)

[See a Live Demo](https://mmingay2.shinyapps.io/tcga_aml/)

[See the Code](https://github.com/mmingay2/tcga_aml)

This app allows you to type in terms of interest (ex. AML) and get gene sets from [MSigDB](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). The genes in the gene set you select will then be coloured red on the RNA-seq scatterplot.

## Javascript Libraries

This is an example of a custom [IGV browser](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/) that can be configurated to display BAM, Wig, BigWig, VCF and a multitude of genomic regions files for validation and exploration.

[Morpheus](https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) is a powerful browser-based javascript tool for visualizing and analyzing high dimensional datasets developed by the Broad Instiute. 

See my [tutorial](https://github.com/mmingay2/coloCancerBrowser) on how to use [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) to run Morpheus locally or in the cloud.
